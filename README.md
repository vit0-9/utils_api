# Go Utility API

A Go-based API designed to provide a robust and efficient collection of useful web, network, and data utilities. This service aims to simplify common developer tasks and assist in various analytical and research activities by offering a centralized, easy-to-use interface for these tools.

## Available Utilities

This API offers a growing suite of tools, including:

* **URL Cleaner:** Strips known tracking parameters (e.g., UTM, click IDs) from URLs for cleaner links or privacy.
* **Redirect Resolver:** Traces HTTP redirects to reveal the final destination URL of a given link, useful for shortlinks or analyzing redirect chains.
* **UTM Generator:** Constructs URLs with custom UTM tracking parameters for marketing campaigns, supporting bulk creation.
* **DNS Lookup:** Performs DNS queries for various record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, CNAME, NS) for a specified domain.
* **IP Information:** Provides basic IP validation, type classification (public/private), reverse DNS, and, if configured, detailed GeoIP/ASN information using MaxMind GeoLite2 databases.
* **HTTP Headers Viewer:** Fetches and displays the complete HTTP response headers from a target URL, aiding in debugging and analysis.
* **Website Technology Stack Analyzer (Wappalyzer):** Identifies the technologies (CMS, frameworks, libraries, etc.) used on a given website.
* **WHOIS Lookup:** Retrieves registration and contact information for a domain name from WHOIS servers.
* **SSL Certificate Checker:** Fetches and displays details about a host's SSL/TLS certificate, including validity, issuer, and chain.
* *(And potentially more utilities as the project evolves)*

For detailed information on each endpoint, specific request/response formats, and all available parameters, please refer to the comprehensive **API Documentation** generated by Swagger.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the API up and running on your local machine or in a Docker container.

### Prerequisites

* **Go:** Ensure you have a recent version of Go installed (version 1.20 or higher is recommended for compatibility with modern language features and libraries).
* **Docker (Optional):** Required if you plan to build and run the application as a Docker container for isolated and portable deployment.
* **MaxMind GeoLite2 Databases (Optional, but recommended for full IP Info functionality):**
  * To enable detailed geolocation (country, city, postal code) and ASN (Autonomous System Number/Organization) lookups for IP addresses, you'll need the GeoLite2 City and ASN database files.
  * Download `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` and `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` from the official [MaxMind GeoLite2 free geolocation data page](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data/). Note that you will need to sign up for a free MaxMind account to access these downloads.
  * After downloading, place these `.mmdb` files into a `data/` directory located in the project root. This path is configurable via environment variables.

### Environment Variables

The application relies on environment variables for key configurations. It's recommended to create a `.env` file in the project root for local development. The application will automatically load this file on startup.

```env
# .env (Example)
MMDB_CITY_PATH="./data/GeoLite2-City.mmdb" # Relative or absolute path to your GeoLite2-City.mmdb file
MMDB_ASN_PATH="./data/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb"   # Relative or absolute path to your GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb file
PORT="8080"                               # Specifies the port on which the API server will listen
GIN_MODE="debug"                          # Sets Gin framework's operational mode: "debug" for development (more verbose logging), "release" for production (optimized performance)
